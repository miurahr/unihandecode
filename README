				   Unihandecode

		     ASCII transliterations of Unicode text
		     that recognize CJKV complex charactors


EXAMPLE USE

	from unihandecode import Unihandecoder
	u = Unihandecoder(lang='ch')
	print d.decode(u"\u660e\u5929\u660e\u5929\u7684\u98ce\u5439")

	# That prints: Ming Tian Ming Tian De Feng Chui 

	u = Unihandecoder(lang='ja')
	print d.decode(
	    u'\u660e\u65e5\u306f\u660e\u65e5\u306e\u98a8\u304c\u5439\u304f')

	# That prints: Ashita ha Ashita no Kaze ga Fuku



DESCRIPTION

    It often happens that you have non-Roman text data in Unicode, but
    you can't display it -- usually because you're trying to show it
    to a user via an application that doesn't support Unicode, or
    because the fonts you need aren't accessible. You could represent
    the Unicode characters as "???????" or "\15BA\15A0\1610...", but
    that's nearly useless to the user who actually wants to read what
    the text says.

    What Unihandecode provides is a function, 'decode(...)' that
    takes Unicode data and tries to represent it in ASCII characters 
    (i.e., the universally displayable characters between 0x00 and 0x7F). 
    The representation is almost always an attempt at *transliteration* 
    -- i.e., conveying, in Roman letters, the pronunciation expressed by 
    the text in some other writing system. (See the example above)

    These are same meaning in both language in example above.
    "明天明天的风吹" for Chinese and "明日は明日の風が吹く" for Japanese.
    The character "明" is converted "Ming" in Chinese. "明日" is converted
    "Ashita" but single charactor "明" will be converted "Mei" in Japanese.

    This is an improved version of Python unidecode,
    that is Python port of Text::Unidecode Perl module by 
    Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org>.

REQUIREMENTS

    This depend on KAKASI library for Japanese pronunciation recognition.
    If it not exist in your system, it use a table of Japanese Kanji to
    Romaji 1:1 mapping.

    You can download KAKASI from http://kakasi.namazu.org/stable/
    If you use Fedora Linux or Ubuntu Linux, please launch your 
    Operating System's package manager and search kakasi package.

INSTALLATION

    You install Unihandecode, as you would install any Python module,
    by running these commands:

	python setup.py install
	python setup.py test

    If you got egg package, it is easy to install by
    $ easy_install Unihandecode-0.10-py2.6.egg

    You need to install kakasi library for Japanese transliteration.

    For Debian/Ubuntu linux, 'apt-get install libkakasi2'
    For Fedora linux, 'yum install kakasi-libs'
    For OpenSUSE, launch YaST and install kakasi-devel and kakasi-dict
    For Mac OS X, see http://kakasi.darwinports.com/
    
    For Windows, 
    download http://www.namazu.org/win32/kakasi-2.3.4.zip
    and extract the zip file to c:\ 

    After install kakasi library, set KAKASILIB environment valiable
    as library directory. ex. 'c:\kakasi\lib\kakasi'
    A default installation path that unihandecode assume is as follows:
      Windows: c:\kakasi
      Mac:     /opt/local/kakasi
      Linux/UNIX:/usr/lib/libkakasi.so,  or where ld.so can find.
