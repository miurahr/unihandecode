                     ASCII transliterations of Unicode text
                     that recognize CJKV complex charactors


EXAMPLE USE
-----------

        from unihandecode import Unihandecoder
        u = Unihandecoder(lang='ch')
        print d.decode(u"\u660e\u5929\u660e\u5929\u7684\u98ce\u5439")

        # That prints: Ming Tian Ming Tian De Feng Chui 

        u = Unihandecoder(lang='ja')
        print d.decode(
            u'\u660e\u65e5\u306f\u660e\u65e5\u306e\u98a8\u304c\u5439\u304f')

        # That prints: Ashita ha Ashita no Kaze ga Fuku



DESCRIPTION
-----------

    It often happens that you have non-Roman text data in Unicode, but
    you can't display it -- usually because you're trying to show it
    to a user via an application that doesn't support Unicode, or
    because the fonts you need aren't accessible. You could represent
    the Unicode characters as "???????" or "\15BA\15A0\1610...", but
    that's nearly useless to the user who actually wants to read what
    the text says.

    What Unihandecode provides is a function, 'decode(...)' that
    takes Unicode data and tries to represent it in ASCII characters 
    (i.e., the universally displayable characters between 0x00 and 0x7F). 
    The representation is almost always an attempt at *transliteration* 
    -- i.e., conveying, in Roman letters, the pronunciation expressed by 
    the text in some other writing system. (See the example above)

    These are same meaning in both language in example above.
    "明天明天的风吹" for Chinese and "明日は明日の風が吹く" for Japanese.
    The character "明" is converted "Ming" in Chinese. "明日" is converted
    "Ashita" but single charactor "明" will be converted "Mei" in Japanese.

    This is an improved version of Python unidecode,
    that is Python port of Text::Unidecode Perl module by 
    Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org>.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

    There is no required staff other than standard python libraries. 
    Because it is still under development for python3, you can use it
    with python2.x.(>2.6)


INSTALLATION
------------

    You install Unihandecode, as you would install any Python module,
    by running these commands:

        python setup.py gendict
        python setup.py genmap
        python setup.py install
        python setup.py test

    If you got egg package, it is easy to install by
    $ easy_install Unihandecode-0.40-py2.7.egg

BUILD
------

    To build egg package, we need additional instruction.

        python setup.py gendict
        python setup.py genmap
        python setup.py bdist_egg

LIMITATION
----------

    This library uses pickler that format is depend on platform
    and python version.
    You should re-create dictionary for each python version.
